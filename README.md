# 0x0101 Installation
```bash
 v@reaper: #~ ./install.sh --help
```

[!] The following steps will guide the process to configure and deploy R.E.A.P.E.R on your Whatsapp BOT (Ensure that you have atleast a second number in order to proceed!). <br>
// Please adhere to the outlined procedures to ensure proper functionality.

> Installation Steps 
> 
>> Open your terminal. Clone the REAPER MD repository and step inside:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARCANGEL0/reaperMD.git
cd reaperMD
npm i -f
```
>
>> Check if you have required Node version with NVM
>> R.E.A.P.E.R needs Node.js version >=20. Use NVM to lock it down:
```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20
```
>> Before running R.E.A.P.E.R, adjust the necessary configuration in the next section.
----

# 0x0110: Configuration
```bash
 v@reaper: #~ curl -i http://0.0.0.0:3301/configuration.dat
```
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The `config.js` file contains essential parameters for R.E.A.P.E.R's operation. Open this file and configure the following settings: 

### Step 1: Adjust reaperMD/config.js
```javascript

global.owner = [
    ["YOUR PERSONAL NUMBER HERE", '𝙊𝙬𝙣𝙚𝙧', true], // Your WhatsApp number (country code + number all together)
];

// if the ANTI PRIVATE function is enabled, private chat with the bot will be restricted except for the numbers in the array below
global.permitido = [
    ["1518833273"], // Insert all numbers together including country code, except the (+)
    ["00000000"], 
    ["00000000"],
    ["00000000"],
    ["00000000"],
    ["00000000"]
];

// Your phonenumber 
global.criador = "1234567890@s.whatsapp.net"; 

// Specify the bot's phone number
global.botNumberCode = ""; // Example: +59309090909 (This must be your second number, where R.E.A.P.E.R will operate)

// API keys (feel free to leave them empty, or fill them if you have the API)
global.lolkeysapi = ""; // LOL Humans API for those quirky moments
global.miftah = ""; // MiftaH API –ts
global.maelyn = "" // Maelyn API 
global.neoxr = ""; // Neoxr API; 
global.itsrose = [""]; // ITSROSE API,
```

### Step 2: Run the Server

[+] To initiate R.E.A.P.E.R, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

// Monitoring System Status: Observe console output for status reports. Error messages indicate potential configuration issues or unmet dependencies. Refer to troubleshooting documentation as necessary.

[!] For interactive authentication, generate a QR code by executing:

```bash
npm run qr
```

>> Optional: Implementing PM2 for Process Management
> To enhance R.E.A.P.E.R's operational stability, PM2 can be utilized for process management.

>> [+] Installation Procedure:
>//1. Verify PM2 installation: Execute the following command to install PM2 globally if not already present:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

>//2. Deploy R.E.A.P.E.R via PM2:

```bash
pm2 start npm --name "reaper" --start
```

>//3. Status Verification: Monitor the operational status of R.E.A.P.E.R:

```bash
pm2 status reaper
```

>> [+] PM2 Management commands:
>//1 Restart R.E.A.P.E.R:
>
```bash
pm2 restart reaper
```
>//2 Stop R.E.A.P.E.R:
>
```bash
pm2 stop reaper
```
>//3. Kill the process:
>
```bash
pm2 delete reaper
```

### Conclusion


If `config.js` file has been configured, the Node.js server initiated, and PM2 has been implemented (if selected) for process management. Last step is to finalize setup, perform the following steps:

```plaintext
>> [!] Authentication Protocol:
> 
//> 1. WhatsApp Authentication: Access your WhatsApp account associated with the R.E.A.P.E.R bot.
//> 2. Device Linking: Navigate to 'Linked Devices' within WhatsApp settings.
//> 3. Authentication Method:
 \-> QR Code: If startup used was `npm run qr`.
  \-> Authentication Code: If startup used was `npm run code`.
```

System Ready: After successful authentication via WhatsApp, R.E.A.P.E.R will establish connection.
