# 0x0010: Bytesec 

Bytesec MD isn't for everyone. It’s designed for the operators who work in the dark, those who know how to navigate complex systems. Inspired by cyber-mystique, this bot was built to empower, to protect, and to probe.

```bash
 root@bytesecf: #~ ./install.sh --help
```

Alright, kiddo. Let’s set up Bytesec MD—no fluff, just the steps you need to get this bot running. You ready? Here we go.

> Installation Steps for Bytesec MD
> 
>> 1. Clone the Repository
>> Open your terminal. Clone the Bytesec MD repository and step inside:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/reaperMD.git
cd reaperMD
```
>
>> 2. Install Required Node Version with NVM
>> Bytesec MD needs Node.js version 18.1.17. If you’re not there, use NVM to lock it down:
```bash
nvm install 18.1.17
nvm use 18.1.17
```
>> Set it as your default, so there are no surprises later:
```bash
nvm alias default 18.1.17
```
> 
3. Install Dependencies
>> Still with me? Good. Now, in the project directory, install what’s needed:
```bash
npm i -f
```
>
> That’s it. Bytesec MD is locked, loaded, and ready to go. You’re all set—now it’s up to you to make it count.

# 0x0110: Configuration
```bash
 root@bytesecf: #~ curl -i http://0.0.0.0:3301/configuration.dat
```
> ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Alright, let’s get to the heart of the matter: configuring config.js. Open that file and prepare to enter the realm of digital wizardry. Here’s what you need to do:

### Step 1: Adjust config.js
```javascript

global.owner = [
    ["447598848203", '𝙊𝙬𝙣𝙚𝙧', true], // Your glorious WhatsApp number (country code + number all together, pal)
];

// Identify the lucky few allowed to slide into reaperMD's DMs
global.permitido = [
    ["1518833273"], // Add any other numbers that deserve your time
    ["00000000"], // Placeholder for extra numbers - because you might get popular
    ["00000000"],
    ["00000000"],
    ["00000000"],
    ["00000000"]
];

// Your phonenumber
global.criador = "351927285125@s.whatsapp.net"; 

// Specify the bot's phone number
global.botNumberCode = ""; // Example: +59309090909 (fill it with reaperMD’s number)

// API keys (feel free to leave them empty, or fill them if you’re fancy)
global.lolkeysapi = ""; // LOL Humans API for those quirky moments
global.miftah = ""; // MiftaH API – because every bot needs its secrets
global.maelyn = "" // Maelyn API - Pretty name, huh
global.neoxr = ""; // Neoxr API; sounds cool, right?
global.itsrose = [""]; // ITSROSE API, because flowers are nice
global.baileys = "@whiskeysockets/baileys"; // The party starter of libraries
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages
Now that your config.js is looking snazzy, let’s make sure you have all the dependencies in place. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
bash
npm install
```
You wouldn’t want to start a revolution with missing pieces now, would you?

### Step 3: Run the Server
Time to unleash reaperMD on the digital world. In your terminal, execute:
```bash
npm start
```
Watch as reaperMD comes to life. If you see any errors, well, that’s just part of the existential dread we call coding.

Or make reaperMD even more interactive! Generate a QR code for scanning by running:
```bash
npm run qr
```
And if you need an authentication code rather than QR to prove you’re not a bot (ironically), use:

```bash
npm run code
```
>> Optional Step: Use PM2 for Process Management
> Want to be the master of your own digital domain? Use PM2 to keep reaperMD running smoothly. Here’s how:
>
> Install PM2 globally (if you haven’t yet):
```bash
npm install -g pm2
```
> Start reaperMD with PM2:
```bash
pm2 start npm --name "reaperMD" -- start
```
> Check the status of your beloved bot:
>
```bash
pm2 status
```
> To generate a new authentication code while reaperMD is working hard:
```bash
pm2 start npm --name "byteSec-code" -- run code
```
>> Manage your sessions like a pro with these PM2 commands:
> Restart reaperMD:
```bash
pm2 restart reaperMD
```
> Stop reaperMD:
```bash
pm2 stop reaperMD
```
> Delete the reaperMD process:
```bash
pm2 delete reaperMD
```
### Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve configured config.js, started your Node.js server, and optionally set up PM2 to keep reaperMD in check. Now go out there and let reaperMD take the digital world by storm. Just remember, it’s all a game, and you’re the player. Happy hacking!
